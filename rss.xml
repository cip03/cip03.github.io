    <title>Pun hazards</title>
    <link>http://clnx.github.io/posts/2016-02-12-name.html</link>
    <description><![CDATA[<h2 id="welcome">Welcome!</h2>
<p>This is my personal blog on functional programming and its applications to graphics, physics and distributive computing. There may be occasional posts on logic + math, and hopefully not too many rants.</p>
<p>I couldn’t find a rigid designator for it so I’m going with the lazy pun instead.</p>
<p>Beside the usual journal content (project updates, etc.) I plan to write “review” articles as grounded and complete as <a href="http://bartoszmilewski.com/" title="Bartosz Milewski&#39;s Programming Cafe">Bartosz Milewski’s</a>, with thoughtful examples as powerful as <a href="http://blog.sigfpe.com/" title="A Neighborhood of Infinity">Dan Piponi’s</a>, while keeping myself on the move as swiftly as <a href="http://jozefg.bitbucket.org/" title="Code &amp; Co">Danny Gratzer’s</a> juggling. And I only publish this preposterous claim now in order to boost my <a href="http://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=2651" title="Article on Scott Aaronson&#39;s blog mentioning this technique">public humiliation learning</a>. Well, not really learning, as without the public notability there will be little outside interference, but even as a motivator it’ll do. I hope.</p>
<h2 id="hakyll-control">Hakyll control</h2>
<p>Overall I’m very happy with <a href="http://jaspervdj.be/hakyll" title="Hakyll">Hakyll</a>. I think this <a href="https://github.com/clnx/clnx.github.io.src" title="Source Repo for this Blog">2</a> - <a href="https://github.com/clnx/clnx.github.io" title="Main GitHub Pages Repo">repo</a> setup is the easiest to work with <a href="https://pages.github.com" title="GitHub Pages">GitHub Pages</a> hosting. I stole some code from Danny’s blog to get me started, but I got going quickly.</p>
<h2 id="web-theme">Web theme</h2>
<p>I started with the default <code>Hakyll</code> theme but made a few adjustments.</p>
<p>All sizes, including fonts and page width, are relative (in <code>em</code> units). There is also no <code>font-family</code> setting, so the site will use the default fonts on all devices. Especially on high-dpi screens your eyes won’t be strained by the microscopic fixed text that so many sport, while on wide screens you won’t need binoculars and current line markers to navigate.</p>
<p>The black icons are vectorial (<em>SVG</em>), so they look good on high-dpi too. With a <em>SVG</em> editor like <a href="https://inkscape.org/en/" title="Inkscape">Inkscape</a> it’s very fast to take some free icon from the net and delete layers, change colors and sizes, or make your own. The hover effect just uses the <em>CSS3</em> <code>opacity</code> property.</p>
<p>I followed Dan’s example and inlined the <em>archive</em> page into <em>home</em> and <em>contact</em> into the footer. The reasoning is this: the text that would normally go there would be something generic, and I hope I’ll write more interesting things in the actual blog. So why would I pin the shittiest posts? Personal info belongs to social networking accounts. Plus, I think it helps with search engines robots’ situational awareness (humans too!) by being more honest. The home page is the index. That’s why it’s called “index.html”.</p>
<p>Hope this pasta is simple enough for a copy.</p>]]></description>
