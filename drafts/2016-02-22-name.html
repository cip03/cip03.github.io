<p>Welcome to the jungle!</p>
<p>This is my personal blog on functional programming and its application to real-time simulation. You may expect intermittent pieces on logic <math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mo>∩</mo><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\cap</annotation></semantics></math> math <math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mo>∩</mo><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\cap</annotation></semantics></math> physics, and hopefully not too many rants. But ultimately, I have no clue what the blog will end up raving about. For all I know it could spawn enormous Juche pumas playing cylindrical Go along Iapetus’ equatorial ridge, sabotaging the moon’s hydrostatic balance.</p>
<p>Worse, I couldn’t seize it a rigid designator, leading to a dangerous pun compromise. But allow me to waste your time by first elaborating incoherently and then, apologizing unconvincingly.</p>
<hr />
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_fixedness" title="Functional fixedness - Wikipedia">Functional fixity</a> is a term from cognitive science describing one’s inability to use an object in a novel way. It’s your memory entangling the representation of the object with that of its intended function, typically after prolonged usage.</p>
<p>For instance, after learning to work a monad to a particular goal, a fledgling Haskeller may feel inclined to blog about what monads are like, promptly forgetting the structure and laws of the mathematical object, a lapse that has little to do, I’ll argue, with the suitability of figurative language for presenting abstract concepts.</p>
<p>Brent Yorgey’s <a href="https://byorgey.wordpress.com/2009/01/12/abstraction-intuition-and-the-monad-tutorial-fallacy/" title="Abstraction, intuition, and the “monad tutorial fallacy”">classic article</a> tells the story of the failed monad tutor who supplies just the root of his intuition and expects the entire tree to magically string along into his reader’s head, confusing, as it were, the simple pattern used for naming common metaphors (<strong>A is B</strong>), with the metaphors themselves, which are relations that develop from basic inter-domain mappings of arbitrary size. The article suggests that humans don’t learn abstract concepts directly, but gradually get accustomed with more of their incarnations and business roles, to the point of epiphany.</p>
<p>But throughout the story there is an undertone, or potential uncharitable reading, of a rusty grammarian that ’splains: <em>“analogy is bad, m’kay?”</em>. The Haskell community was quick to pick up on it, and confessed they actually <em>take no pickle with <a href="http://blog.plover.com/prog/burritos.html" title="Monads are like burritos - The Universe of Discourse">burrito</a> expositions</em>. And I concur, even outright allegories are fly as long as the mapping maintains a sense of <a href="http://blog.sigfpe.com/2014/05/types-and-two-approaches-to-problem.html" title="Types, and two approaches to problem solving - A Neighborhood of Infinity">faithfulness</a> that allows crisscrossing the domain boundaries without garbling the meaning, and the author doesn’t forget to mention all of its independent generators.</p>
<p>I also think that people are pretty good at it<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>, and the confusion Brent’s article poses is a bit of a straw man, as the real problem is not only deeper, but it affects smart, educated people significantly more. I’m talking about functional fixity, a case of <em>“the curse of knowledge”</em>, two concepts I’ve recently been exposed to by Steven Pinker’s wonderful book <a href="http://wadler.blogspot.ro/2016/02/steven-pinkers-sense-of-style.html" title="Steven Pinker's The Sense of Style - Wadler's Blog">“The Sense of Style”</a>.</p>
<p>Knowledge is cursed by intelligence, the book goes<a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>. More intelligence founds more opportunities for the curse to strike, and intensifies the virulence inside each area. Imagine a cloud-hosted compiler so smart, that it understands your program is socially or economically expandable, and all of it gets eliminated as dead code. You’d have to fight it, politically. Likewise, our extra keen memory will be better at compressing our experience of the <em>path</em> we took to reach it, to a more lucrative, but potentially deceitful arrangement.</p>
<p>But this doesn’t mean our metaphor is somehow fundamentally mangled, rendered useless for teaching, or worse, all metaphors are, and only some thoroughly puritan hard work can make you comprehend a heavenly subject. On the contrary, the monad tutor is orthodox in believing that <em>“if it works for me, it could help others too”</em>. It’s all a question of making sure it actually works, and having a consistent &amp; complete rendition, which can be achieved, against the odds brought about by the curse of knowledge, with analogy remodeling and some, well, hard work.</p>
<p>When writing about something, notwithstanding your preference for the <strong>classic style</strong> of exposition, where you speak as if you have something to show and you’re merely guiding the reader towards a <em>better vantage point</em>, you are still essentially creating entirely new knowledge, and should only consider what you already know as one among many aids. But the classic style itself is exactly such an aid, specifically a metaphor, recommended for its efficiency in reducing the bloat caused by, to quote Pinker, <em>“metadiscourse, signposting, hedging, apologizing, professional narcissism, clichés, mixed metaphors, metaconcepts, zombie nouns, and unnecessary passives”</em>.</p>
<p>Rather then wailing destitution, potatoes can elate your salvation.<a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<hr />
<p>Now look at what happened during the previous section. In a narcissistic bid to justify the pun in the name of the website, I’ve expanded and duct-taped an argument resting on a misinterpretation of Brent’s article. This reveals the fundamental moral hazard that figurative language imparts. If you want to be the funny guy but mess up your punch lines, it’s just your audience that would have payed up the price. Eventually though, you’ll end up with negative credit.</p>
<p>The safe bet is to use a single, well known, overarching allegory, like the one at the core of the classic style, aka <em>the hitchhiker’s guide</em>. If you also yearn for local boosts, make sure they are connected in a tree of relatedness, and enforce a cost restriction for each fork. The payload you provide must be worth the context switch your reader will have to carry out when changing branch; it needs not be atomic though, just an admix of staggered reimbursements, like with <a href="http://www.cambridge.org/ro/academic/subjects/computer-science/programming-languages-and-applied-logic/purely-functional-data-structures?format=PB&amp;isbn=9780521663502" title="Chris Okasaki - Purely Functional Data Structures">Okasaki’s</a> <em>banker’s method</em>.</p>
<p>I leave this cortege of thought in its current insolvent state, as a testament for future me: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBu7b1jMUrU" title="I did watch it! The save! - Matt Malone"><em>Watch it!</em></a></p>

<li id="fn1"><p>This statement introduces the central incoherency, as the main point is about hazards and such, but this was the last opportunity to lead into my functional fixity stuff. Without it, the non sequitur would have been all too obvious.<a href="#fnref1">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn2"><p>Not really. I start by paraphrasing, but quickly devolve into unsupported interpretations.<a href="#fnref2">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn3"><p>This whack of poetry was originally some place above, but every paragraph passed it on in aversion, all the way to the back of the section where, amusingly, it met Pinker’s lament about mixed metaphors.<a href="#fnref3">↩</a></p></li>
